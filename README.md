# Exploring-Clustering-Algorithms
experiment with multiple clustering methods (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative)
## ðŸ“˜ Project Description
This repository contains explorations of various clustering algorithms with a focus on practical applications, such as customer segmentation. The goal is to understand how different techniques perform in real-world scenarios and how they can be applied to uncover hidden patterns in data.
